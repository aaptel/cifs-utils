=head1 NAME

setcifsacl - Userspace helper to alter an ACL in a security descriptor for Common Internet File System (CIFS)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

setcifsacl [-v|-a|-D|-M|-S] "{one or more ACEs}" {file system object}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.

B<setcifsacl> is a userspace helper program for the Linux CIFS client
file system.  It is intended to alter an ACL of a security descriptor
for a file system object.  Whether a security descriptor to be set is
applied or not is determined by the CIFS/SMB server.

This program uses a plugin to handle the mapping of user and group
names to SIDs.  F<@pluginpath@> should be a symlink that points to the
correct plugin to use.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h>

Print usage message and exit.

=item B<-v>

Print version number and exit.

=item B<-a>

Add one or more ACEs to an ACL of a security descriptor.  An ACE is
added even if the same ACE exists in the ACL.

=item B<-D>

Delete one or more ACEs from an ACL of a security descriptor.  Entire
ACE has to match in an existing ACL for the listed ACEs to be deleted.

=item B<-M>

Modify one or more ACEs from an ACL of a security descriptor.  SID and
type are used to match for existing ACEs to be modified with the list
of ACEs specified.

=item B<-S>

Set an ACL of security descriptor with the list of ACEs Existing ACL
is replaced entirely with the specified ACEs.

Every ACE entry starts with "ACL:" One or more ACEs are specified
within double quotes.  Multiple ACEs are separated by a comma.

Following fields of an ACE can be modified with possible values:

=over

=item B<SID> - Either a name or a raw SID value.

=item B<type> - ALLOWED (0x0), DENIED (0x1), OBJECT_ALLOWED (0x5),
OBJECT_DENIED (0x6)

=item B<flags> - OBJECT_INHERIT_FLAG (OI or 0x1),
CONTAINER_INHERIT_FLAG (CI or 0x2), NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_FLAG (NI or
0x4), INHERIT_ONLY_FLAG (IO or 0x8), INHERITED_ACE_FLAG (IA or 0x10)
or a combination/OR of these values.

=item B<mask> - Either one of FULL, CHANGE, READ, a combination of R W
X D P O, or a hex value

       setcifsacl -a "ACL:CIFSTESTDOM\user1:ALLOWED/OI|CI|NI/D" <file_name>

=head2 Delete an ACE

       setcifsacl -D "ACL:S-1-1-0:0x1/OI/0x1201ff" <file_name>

=head2 Modify an ACE

       setcifsacl -M "ACL:CIFSTESTDOM\user1:ALLOWED/0x1f/CHANGE" <file_name>

=head2 Set an ACL

       setcifsacl -S "ACL:CIFSTESTDOM\Administrator:0x0/0x0/FULL,ACL:CIFSTESTDOM\user2:0x0/0x0/FULL" <file_name>
