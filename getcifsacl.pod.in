getcifsacl - Userspace helper to display an ACL in a security descriptor for Common Internet File System (CIFS)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

getcifsacl [-v|-r] {file system object}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.

getcifsacl is a userspace helper program for the Linux CIFS client
file system. It is intended to display a security descriptor including
ACL for a file system object.

This program uses a plugin to handle the mapping of SIDs to user and
group names.  F<@pluginpath@> should be a symlink that points to the
correct plugin to use.

Fields of an ACE such as SID, type, flags, and mask are displayed
separated by /.  Numeric values of type, flags, and mask are displayed
in hexadecimal format.
